I'm starting to build an asteroids game using JS to get more familiar with using the language and its application.

Quite literally a step by step basis to learn how to code this game. I'm going to highlight things in this readme for myself to look at

These are the steps I'll follow in creating this game. 

1. Project Setup
//things that I'll need to start coding
2. Create a Player
3. Move and rotate Player
4. Shoot projectiles
5. Spawn asteroids
6. Hit asteroids
7. Game Over

How to open the game
1. Open folder with whatever file opener you have
2. Open the game with Google Chrome
3. It should open a black canvas document with a spaceship
